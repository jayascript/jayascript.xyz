Summary: I didn't find a comprehensive enough table for this exercise anywhere else online, so I'm sharing my own.

> "There won't be any code in this exercise, so there's no *What You Should See* or *Study Drills* sections. In fact, this exercise is like one giant *Study Drills*. I'm going to have you do a review of what you have learned so far."

Exercise 22 of *Learn Python the Hard Way* by Zed A. Shaw asks us to create a master list of Python symbols and keywords that we've learned so far. I looked online for examples of other developers' tables, but I couldn't find one that was comprehensive enough to cover everything I wanted to include. I'm sharing my own table here in case it helps out anyone else.

| Keyword/Character                                     | Name                                             | Type                           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |     |

Should only be used in the interpreter because it relies on the `site` module, which adds several constants to the built-in namespace that are useful for the interactive interpreter shell, but not for programs.                                                            |     |

The `-p` option will also create all directories in the file hierarchy above the desired one if they don't already exist.                                                                                                                                                   |     |

| `ls`                                                  | list                                             | Unix shell command             | Lists computer files. Common options include `-l` for long format; `-f` for don't sort; `-F` to append suffix to reveal the file type; `-a` to list hidden files and dirs; `-R` to recursively list subdirs; `-t` to sort by last modified; `-h` to print sizes in human-readable formats; `-1` to force output to one per line. |     |
| `print(*objects, sep=' ', end='\n', file=sys.stdout)` | print function                                   | built-in Python function       | Print to the text stream `file` (default is the screen/stdout), separated by `sep` and followed by `end`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |     |
| `#`                                                   | hashtag; pound sign; octothorpe                  | Python special character       | Used to denote a comment. Anything following it will be ignored by the computer. Meant for human use, to make helpful notes about a line or section of code, including what it does and why.                                                                                                                                     |     |

Variable at `index=0` is always the script name.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |     |

If available bytes is less than `size`, then reads the entire file. Returns the bytes as a string.                                                                                                                                                                                       |     |
| `fileObject.close()`                                  | close method                                     | Python file object method      | Flushes any unwritten info of a `file` object and closes it, after which no more writing can be done. While Python auto-closes files when the reference object has been reassigned, it's good practice to do this explicitly.                                                                                                    |     |

May return an incomplete line if the `size` argument is passed.                                                                                                                                                                  |     |

Does not work in read-only mode.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |     |

May be binary data, not just text. Does not append a newline character to the end of the string.                                                                                                                                                                                         |     |

Returns `False` for broken symlinks.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |     |

May be a sequence (i.e. str, bytes, tup, list, range) or collection (i.e. dictionary, set, frozenset).                                                                                                                                                                        |     |

Those are all the specific instances of new characters and keywords I could find this time around. Now, because I've been coding with Python for a while now, I know many more that aren't included here. However, I want to stick with the outline of the book and proceed in order. Hopefully there will be another exercise like this one to complete in the future. In the meantime, enjoy the information!
